# CyberStart Scripts

This is a collection of python scripts that I wrote in relation to the Cyberstart America/ Cyberstart Fast Track program. These are almost entirely moon base related, specifically higher level challenges given their more technical nature. I omitted one line linux commands commonly used throughout the headquarter challenges. 
This contains scripts for brute forcing, data parsing, server enumeration, and encryption.

## Moonbase

This folder consists of python scripts written for the various levels of the moonbase challenges. Most are labelled with which specific challenge they solve. Note that these were all functional for 2022-2023, there is no guarentee the challenges have not changed since then or that these solutions still work. 

## Update 1/15/24

With the end of the Cyberstart program, this repository will become an archive.
